## hoprd node section - your hoprd node that acts as the connection entry point

[hoprd_node]

# URL pointing to the API access of your hoprd node with scheme and port (e.g., `http://192.168.0.89:3001`)
endpoint = "<your hoprd node API endpoint>"

# API access token
api_token = "<your hoprd node API token>"

# Container forwarded connection port â€“ if your hoprd node runs inside a Docker container,
# this should match the forwarded TCP/UDP port into the container.
# Note: This is NOT your API port, which must be specified in the `endpoint` field.
# This port is an additional port used to establish the tunnel connection on your hoprd node.
# In general, if you want to establish a connection on a specific port, simply provide that port here.

## destinations section - configure available target destinations

[destinations]

# exit node address (where the connection should terminate)
# [destinations.<address>]
# additional information about this exit node
# meta = { location = <location> }
# session path should either be intermediates or hops = {nr}
# path = { intermediates = [ "12D3KooWFUD4BSzjopNzEzhSi9chAkZXRKGtQJzU482rJnyd2ZnP" ] }

## connection section - adjust for more fine grained connection control

# [connection]
# listen host - specify the internal listen host on your hoprd node.
# If you have a firewall running and can only use static ports, you need to adjust this setting.
# It is best to only use the `internal_connection_port` from the [hoprd_node] section.
# If listen_host is enabled, `internal_connection_port` is ignored.
# listen_host = "0.0.0.0:1422"
# session timeout - specify HTTP timeout for session requests.
# While this will be used for all HTTP request, it will only have a real impact on session creation requests.
# session_timeout = "15s"

# determine specific connection parameters for ephemeral bridge connection
# [connection.bridge]
# capabilities = [ "segmentation", "retransmission" ]
# target = "172.30.0.1:8000"

# determine specific connection parameters for persistent main connection
# [connection.wg]
# capabilities = [ "segmentation" ]
# target = "172.30.0.1:51820"

###
## wireguard section - specific VPN-related settings

# [wireguard]
# interface listen port for incoming connections; defaults to 51820
# listen_port = 51820
# manually override derived allowed_ips for the WireGuard interface
# allowed_ips = "10.128.0.1/9"
# GnosisVPN will handle this automatically, but can only do so on supported platforms.
# If you manually handle the WireGuard interface, you need to specify a public_key here
# [wireguard.manual_mode]
# public_key = "<your WireGuard public key>"
