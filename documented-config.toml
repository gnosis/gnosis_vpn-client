# Note: This is NOT your API port, which must be specified in the `endpoint` field.

# In general, if you want to establish a connection on a specific port, simply provide that port here.

# [connection]
# listen host - specify the internal listen host on your hoprd node.
# If you have a firewall running and can only use static ports, you need to adjust this setting.
# It is best to only use the `internal_connection_port` from the [hoprd_node] section.
# If listen_host is enabled, `internal_connection_port` is ignored.

## wireguard section - specific VPN-related settings

# allowed_ips = "10.128.0.1/9"
