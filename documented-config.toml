## hoprd node section - your hoprd node that acts as the connection entry point

# Container forwarded connection port – if your hoprd node runs inside a Docker container,
# this should match the forwarded TCP/UDP port into the container.
# Note: This is NOT your API port, which must be specified in the `endpoint` field.
# This port is an additional port used to establish the tunnel connection on your hoprd node.
# In general, if you want to establish a connection on a specific port, simply provide that port here.
